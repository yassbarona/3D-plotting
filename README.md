## Description

This scripts allows you to search any adress within the Flemish region, select the range in squares meters (m²) and visualize the result in 3D.

## Instalation

In order to install this game proceed with the folowing steps:

  1- Clone the code from the repository in the address https://github.com/yassbarona/3D-plotting/
  
  2- Open your termial
  
  3- Go to the folder you just cloned from Github
  
  4- Type the command "pyton main.py"
  
  5- Enjoy!
  
  ## Instructions
  
  1- Type the address that you would like to find. If the address is incorrect or not specific enough, the script will ask you to type the address again.
  
  2- The script will show you back the result it found. Verify if the result is the address that you are looking for. If that's the case type "Y" for yes or "N" for no.

  3- Type now the range in squres meters (m²) that you would like to visualize. The bigger the surface the longer it will take, so the script is set to a seacrh with a maximum of 5000m², if you select an area bigger than that , the script will ask you to scale down to a smaller area. 

  4- The script is set to render the image on your default browser, this allows a better visualization and interaction with the resulted image. 
  
  5- any modification of the pre-set settings can be done directly over the cloned script. For any further request, feel free to contact us at : support@flemish3Dploting.eth
